# Generalised_Data_Structure_Library

🔹 Project Overview

The Generalised Data Structure Library (GDSL) is a reusable and extensible library that provides a unified, generic implementation of commonly used data structures. The goal of this project is to eliminate code duplication by offering data-type independent (generalised) operations that can be easily reused across multiple applications.

This library is designed with modularity, efficiency, and clarity in mind, making it suitable for academic learning, interview preparation, and real-world system programming projects.

🔹 Key Features

✅ Generic Implementation – Supports multiple data types using abstraction

✅ Reusable Codebase – Write once, use across multiple projects

✅ Standard Operations – Insert, Delete, Search, Traverse, Count

✅ Well-Structured Design – Separation of interface and implementation

✅ Beginner-Friendly – Clean code with logical flow and comments

🔹 Data Structures Implemented

Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Singly Circular Linked List

Doubly Circular Linked List

Stack

Queue

Binary Search Tree

Each data structure follows a common interface, ensuring consistency and ease of use.

🔹 Technologies Used

Language: C / C++

Concepts:

Pointers & Dynamic Memory Allocation

Abstraction & Encapsulation

Modular Programming

Algorithmic Optimization

🔹 Project Motivation

In most beginner and intermediate projects, data structures are rewritten for every new data type. This project demonstrates how generalisation can be applied to build scalable and maintainable libraries, similar to those used in real-world software systems.

🔹 Who Can Use This?

🎓 Students learning Data Structures & Algorithms

💻 Developers building system-level or backend projects

🧠 Candidates preparing for technical interviews

🔹 Future Enhancements

Template-based implementation (C++)

Iterator support

Exception handling

Performance benchmarking
