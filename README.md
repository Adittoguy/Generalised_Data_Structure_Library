📚 GDSL – Generalised Data Structure Library
🔹 Overview

GDSL (Generalised Data Structure Library) is a reusable and extensible library that provides generic implementations of fundamental data structures using a unified and consistent interface.
The primary objective of this project is to eliminate data-type dependency and promote code reusability, modularity, and clean design.

This library is ideal for students, system programmers, and interview preparation, offering clear logic and well-structured implementations.

🎯 Objectives

Avoid rewriting data structures for different data types

Provide a single, unified interface for all data structures

Encourage modular and maintainable programming

Improve understanding of internal working of data structures

🧱 Data Structures Implemented

Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Singly Circular Linked List

Doubly Circular Linked List

Stack

Queue

Binary Search Tree

Each data structure supports standard operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and counting elements.

✨ Key Features

✔️ Generic & reusable implementations

✔️ Clean and modular code structure

✔️ Standardized operations across data structures

✔️ Easy to integrate into other projects
